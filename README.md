## Deployment

Our current active project is always active at [pythonisterrible.cf](https://pythonisterrible.cf/). If we have a new active project, this project will continue to be available at [maths.pythonisterrible.cf](https://maths.pythonisterrible.cf/). The `development` branch, if active, is available at [dev-maths.pythonisterrible.cf](https://dev-maths.pythonisterrible.cf/).

Committed changes are deployed to Cloudflare Pages. If you want to deploy manually to your own server, go for it, but we aren't going to support it.

*Edit:* To avoid certain people from spam committing and filling up my quota of Cloudflare Pages builds, deployments are manually changed by Noreen.
